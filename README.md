# 2FA

This project is a Django-based Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) system that adds an extra layer of security to any application or software. It uses email-based One-Time Passwords (OTP) that are valid for 30 seconds, ensuring time-sensitive identity verification. If multiple incorrect OTP attempts are made, the system temporarily locks out the user for 2 minutes as a security measure. This system is ideal for protecting sensitive data and can be easily integrated into existing applications to enhance login security.
